## Description

N-body simulations of the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters and galaxies.

## Installation

First, clone this repository.

> git clone https://gitlab.com/CoronalRain/Nbody.git

Once the repo is successfully cloned, navigate to the Nbody directory and build the executable by either running the build.sh script or using the command

> pyinstaller nbody.spec

Assuming you have the most recent version of pyinstaller, this should create an executable in the dist folder. You're now ready to use the Nbody Simulator!
